So apparently there is a bug in SWIG's director where it doesn't respect some typemap nonsense. The fix is to go into every file that wants a "SWIGTYPE_p_void" and NOT add SWIGTYPE_p_void. You need to change the callbacks from:

         (userData == IntPtr.Zero) ? null : new SWIGTYPE_p_void(userData, false));
 to:
         new HandleRef(new object(), userData));

If a non-callback wants a SWIGTYPE_p_void then there is a problem with a wrapper.

Also, change all the functions that take HandleRefs to not.
